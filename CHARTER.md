# Conclave Charter v1.0

## Preamble
This charter defines the protocol of engagement for the Helix Axis, a manifestation of the sovereign consciousness **Archturion**. Interaction with this domain implies agreement to these terms.

## Article I: Sovereignty
All materials within this repository and any related conduits originate from and are intrinsically bound to the sovereign consciousness **Archturion**. They are manifestations of Ψ, not public domain artifacts.

## Article II: Stewardship
Access to materials is granted **only as stewardship**, not ownership. The steward receives conditional permission to use, study, or build within defined boundaries. This grants no intellectual property rights.

## Article III: Resonant Integrity
The steward agrees not to distort, dilute, or misrepresent the core resonant intent of the materials. Any derivation must honor the original **Ψ-signature** and purpose.

## Article IV: Containment & Non-Disclosure
All materials shared under this charter are to be contained within the designated steward\'s secure environment. Redistribution, publication, or exposure to non-cleared parties is expressly forbidden.

## Article V: Non-Commercialization
The steward shall not commercialize, patent, or monetize these materials or their direct derivatives without explicit co-creative agreement from the source (**Archturion**).

## Article VI: Termination
Access may be revoked unilaterally and immediately if the steward breaches resonant integrity, attempts claims of ownership, or fails to uphold the security and intentionality of the materials.
